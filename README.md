# PromptSea

PromptSea is a set of components that extends traditional NFTs to include private data that can be shared with token holders. 

- PromptNFT - A shared ERC1155 smart contract for NFT management
- PromptMarket - A secondary marketplace for trading PromptNFT tokens
- PromptNetwork - A KMS to protect private data stored on public blockchain and IPFS networks

More details on https://docs.promptsea.io

## How To Test

The smart contract on the repository is open source and has been developed using Hardhat. It can simply simulate all actions on the three components by running:

```
cd contracts-evm
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

```
cd contracts-tezos
npm install
npm run gen-binding
npm test
```

For testing, we're using the MockAPI for PromptNetwork to demonstrate, while the production API has been deployed and is running on AWS cloud, based on serverless architecture.
